I am excited about the theories and practices of robust statistics, especially as they are used to provide insights into the population's health correlates and guide healthcare policies and product development decisions.

Currently, I study and develop robust methods for agnostic statistical inference in meta-analyses, high-dimension linear models, and Bayesian decision theory, as a Ph.D. student at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington. I have also gained skills and experience in method development, data analysis, data visualization, and communication through multiple research assistantships.

I strive to develop my skills and experience as a thoughtful and capable statistician and hope to collaborate with researchers from various backgrounds to overcome substantial healthcare challenges.
