I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics at University of Washington. I graduated from Peking University with a B.S. in Biology and a double major in Applied Mathematics. My dissertation advisor is Professor Kenneth Rice. Our work includes developing robust inference for meta-analysis, shrinkage estimators with robust risk properties and robust decision-theoretic inference. I am also a research assistant at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, under the supervision of Professor Peter Gilbert and Dr. Yunda Huang. In my free time, I like listening to podcasts, reading and hiking.
